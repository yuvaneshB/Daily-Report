Today the internship started, Kowshik took the morning session, he explained about  function declaration and variables. A function is a subprogram that can take parameters and return a single value. A function has two parts, the specification and the body. The specification (spec for short) begins with the keyword function and ends with the return clause, which specifies the datatype of the return value. Parameter declarations are optional. Functions that take no parameters are written without parentheses. The function body begins with the keyword IS (or AS) and ends with the keyword end followed by an optional function name. The function body has three parts, an optional declarative part, an executable part, and an optional exception handling part. The declarative part contains declarations of types, cursors, constants, variables, exceptions, and subprograms. A declaration of a variable is where a program says that it needs a variable. For our small programs, place declaration statements between the two braces of the  main  method. The declaration gives a name and a data type for the variable. It may also ask that a particular value be placed in the variable. In a high level language the programmer does not need to worry about how the computer hardware actually does what was asked. If you ask for a variable of type long, you get it. If you ask for the value 123 to be placed in the variable.
dart is an open source language developed in Google with the aim of allowing developers to use an object oriented language with static type analysis. Function declaration in A variable must be declared before it is used. Dart uses the var keyword to achieve the same. The syntax for declaring a variable is as given below var name = 'jean'; All variables in dart store a reference to the value rather than containing the value.
After the lunch break I met one of the frontend designers Arul, he explained about figma tools and how to use the tools to create model pages step by step to learn.move and scroll tool When you open files in the editor, Figma will select the move tool V by default .The Move tool allows you to select and reorder layers in the layers panel, or move objects around on the canvas.

Then Rexilia took the session, she explained about javascript used in html & css, html provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like css and javascript. css is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. javascript is used to control the behaviour of different elements. If you are learning web development, you will come across terms like html, css, and javascript. These are often called the building blocks of the Web. These three tools dominate web development.
