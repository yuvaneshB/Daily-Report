Today my internship started. I am learning about creating a web page and trying to create a model of the web page. The programming code is written step by step. Create a model page of the web page. After the lunch break Rexilia took the session, she explained about creating a registration page in html & css. To use tags the <label> tag is used to create labels for items in a user interface. Used within <input> tags on a form, the <label> tag is additionally useful because it extends the clickable area of control elements, like buttons. A radio button is an element of the graphical user interface ( gul) which allows a user to select a single item from a predefined list of options. Radio buttons are often arranged in a group of at least two options. They take the form of a hollow circle which represents a "deselected" state and a circle with a dot inside for a selected state. The <input type="checkbox"> defines a checkbox. The checkbox is shown as a square box that is ticked (checked) when activated. Checkboxes are used to let a user select one or more options of a limited number of choices. submit button to forms is to user clicks it, it automatically submits the form. It takes a value attribute, which defines the text that appears inside the button, input with a type set to button creates a button, which can be manipulated onClick event listener type. It creates a button just like an input type of submit. Then Askin took the session, he explained about array, push, pop, object, string and mdn. array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value. Push operation of the stack is used to add an item to a stack at the top. We can perform push operations only at the top of the stack.  Before inserting an item in the stack we must check that the stack should have some empty space. Pop operation is performed on the stack to remove items from the stack. We can perform the pop operation only at the top of the stack. In an array implementation of pop() operation, the data element is not actually removed, instead the top is decremented to a lower position in the stack to point to the next value. the object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method. As regions of memory, they contain value and are referenced. A string is a data type used in programming, that is used to represent text rather than numbers. A string is a sequence of characters and can contain letters, numbers, symbols and even spaces. It must be enclosed in quotation marks for it to be recognized as a string. Meet my mentor Gayathri, she explains git methods, gives presentation ideas and tips. That is all about today.
