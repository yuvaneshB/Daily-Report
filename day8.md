 learned in html css, how to create the web page, i tried all the some tags to create the model. Explain some tag working process.The <style> tag is used to define style information (css) for a document.Inside the <style> element you specify how html elements should render in a browser. how to create border and text alignment, The border-style property specifies what kind of border to display. The border-style property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).The css margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. The css margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. Css has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element (margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-left, margin-right) margin-top: the margin is top of the page, margin-bottom: create the margin bottom of the page, margin-left: create the margin left side of the page and margin-right: create the margin right side of the page. All the margin properties can have the following values. auto - the browser calculates the margin, length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm and % - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element. These are all the tags used to create the new program and run get output. After Rexilia took the session, she explained the difference between inline css and internal css. Inline css contains the css property in the body section attached with an element known as inline css. This kind of style is specified within an html tag using the style attribute. Inline css is used in single line all the commands are used. internal css stylesheets by placing the <style> element in the <head> section of a page. Internal styles apply to whole pages but not to multiple html documents. Several pages can be styled by repeating the same block of internal styles in them. Internal css is used in specific tags and writes all the comments.Try to type an internal css program and run the program to get the output. After the lunch break I met my mentor Gayathri, she told me how to write a test case and gave some examples. A test case is a document, which has a set of test data, preconditions, expected results and postconditions, developed for a particular test scenario in order to verify compliance against a specific requirement.  I will try to write a test case and explain some process. Then Askin took the session, he explained about the algorithm and discussed the process. What is an algorithm? Algorithms are a step by step process in the following method. An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. Every computerized device uses algorithms, which cut the time required to do things manually and give some examples. He gave some questions to create an algorithm and gave each team three members to solve the algorithm. I revise all the process myself.
