Create a html file to write a tag,The <html> tag represents the root of an html document. <head> header tag it uses like to give some title and heading.<p> paragraph tag use write a paragraph. The <title> tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text only, and it is shown in the browser title bar or in the page tab. <td> tag defines a standard data cell in an HTML table. An HTML table consists of one <table> element and one or more <tr>, <th>, and <td> elements. <body> body tag,The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists. The <style> tag is used to define style information (css) for a document, inside the <style> element you specify how html elements should render in a browser.The <br> tag inserts a single line break,tag is useful for writing addresses or poems,it is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag and <b> tag is bold font, <u> tag is underline font, <l> tag is italic font. The < center > tag was used in html4 (not supported in html5) to centre-align text. The <button> tag defines a clickable button, Always specify the type attribute for a <button> element, to tell browsers what type of button. This all the process of working and trying different types of tags practices.
