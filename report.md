The four week of internship, I learned a lot of things. I learned about the sdlc software development life cycle, it is explained in planning, requirement analysis, architectural design, software deployment and testing.
Planning-This information is then used to plan the basic project approach and to conduct product feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas.
Requirement analysis Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts.
Architectural Design -A design approach clearly defines all the architectural modules of the product along with its communication and data flow.
Software Development-Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organisation and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to generate the code.
Testing-This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern sdlc models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of sdlc
maintenance-the product is tested and ready to be deployed, it is released formally in the appropriate market. Sometimes product deployment happens in stages as per the business strategy of that organisation. Then learn defects, bugs, errors and failure. Defect is the variation between the actual results and expected results is known as defect, if a developer finds an issue and corrects it by himself in the development phases then it is called a defect. Bugs are the result of a coding error. An error found in the development environment before the product is shipped to the customer. A programming error that causes a program to work poorly, produce incorrect results or crash. An error in software or hardware that causes a program to malfunction. A bug is the terminology of a tester. Error is a mistake, misconception, or misunderstanding on the part of a software developer. In the category of the developer, we include software engineers, programmers, analysts, and testers for example, a developer may misunderstand a design notation, or a programmer might type a variable name incorrectly which leads to an error. It is the one that is generated because of the wrong login, loop or syntax. The error normally arises in software; it leads to a change in the functionality of the program. Failure is the inability of a software system or component to perform its required functions within specified performance requirements. When a defect reaches the end customer it is called a failure. During development, Failures are usually observed by testers. Then I learned the difference between test case, test script, test scenario and test condition. Test case it is mainly used to test any particular function or any specific aspect of the developed software. Test cases tell that a necessity is completely fulfilled after testing. Test Case is an arrangement of conditions based on the tester performing testing application. Test script refers to a set of instructions or short program which tests some portion of the functionality of a software product. It is also known as an Automated Test Script because it tests an application automatically. If any test is composed as a small program it is viewed as automatic test scripts. Test Scenario refers to all possible ways of testing a software application. Each probable way or method tests any part of the application like all possible functionalities, attributes, features and aspects of the software,and Test condition refers to the specification to which the tester follows to perform the testing operation of the software. There can be multiple test conditions to test any software scenario. I learned to write test cases and types of testing. Manual testing is a software testing process in which test cases are executed manually without using any automated tool. All test cases executed by the tester manually according to the end user's perspective. It ensures whether the application is working, as mentioned in the requirement document or not.  White box testing, black box testing and grey box testing. 
Then in between the session Kowshik & Ameen took the session to problem solving method and process to explain and install centos, install git process also explain Ameen explain install centos and create git account an use basic command to use the gitlab. Then Kowshik gives some questions to solve the problems, in the process they are used to the quick learning and easy to understand the problem to find the answers. First he gave a jar question to calculate the in methed. Give two jars, one is a 5 litre jar, another one is a 3 litre jar to get 4 litre of water in a 5 litre jar. Listen to the given question and fill the water in the jar, to use logical thinking to find the answer. Another puzzle solving questions -listen the given numbers, find the empty space,move only one number at a time, To arrange the number one by one, It moves clockwise or anticlockwise and the train process, it moves up,moves down,moves left and moves right, Their process is used to solve the puzzle. Then how to solve the problem solving ways, Read the problem and rescarching find the constraints. Understand the problem, listen to all the constraints, Find possible operations, Reassigning the operation, while satisfying all the constraints, Clear all the problems easily. He also explained about logic gates AND, OR and NOT arithmetic operators, boolean operators, and explained variables and function declaration variables as a quantity that may change within the context of a mathematical problem or experiment. Typically, we use a single letter to represent a variable. The letters x,y and z are common generic symbols used for variables. And function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function. Askin discusses responsibility, English grammar and friendship. Kalyan and Arul both are explained in figma designs, figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web based, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows. The Figma mobile app for Android and ios allows viewing and interacting with Figma prototypes in real time mobile devices. figma tools and how to use the tools to create model pages step by step to learn.move and scroll tool When you open files in the editor, Figma will select the move tool V by default .The Move tool allows you to select and reorder layers in the layers panel, or move objects around on the canvas. Frame and slice tool Use the keyboard shortcuts A or F to select the frame tool. Create a frame with your own dimensions in the canvas or select a frame size from figma is presets in the right hand panel. Click the arrow next to the frame tool to access the slice tool. The Slice tool allows you to specify a region of the screen you want to export and Use the keyboard shortcut S to select the Slice tool. Shape tool In addition to drawing your own shapes using the pen tool, there are a number of default shapes you can use in figma. rectangle , line, arrows, ellipse, star, poligon and place image. To start creating the model of a web application and mobile application to create the model designs. It is all the basic model to create in the figma designs. 
After the Rexilia session I learned html program, html & css and javascript. Inline css, internal css and external css. Inline css means putting css into an html file instead of an external css. Since inline css allows the application of a unique style to one HTML element, its usage is limited but is beneficial for creating unique attributes. Internal css is used to define a style for a single html page. An internal css is defined in the <head> section of an html page, within a <style> element. The following example sets the text colour of ALL the <h1> elements to blue, and the text colour of all the <p> elements to red, and external css is a separate css file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page, and works all the tags to create the login page and registration page. Then she explained javascript, a language is widely used to create a more interactive front-end. Still, it is used in competition with other languages to create web scrapers, servers, and many other tools. This is because of the language and design decisions made when creating the language. I learned to declare a variable in the javascript. All the processes are useful to create the web application. I learned all the methods to use in my projects.
