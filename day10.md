Today's internship was good. It was learning about git and html. Git is a devop tool used for source code management. It is a free and open source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to track changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development. Git basics also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Requests are one such popular tool that allows teams to collaborate on git branches and efficiently review each other's code. Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development. Html and css to create a login page, use the tags step by step, to understand the coding to create a login model to try to search their models programs. Askin took the session explaining about algorithms, how to write algorithms step by step and understand the given question to start writing their steps. Algorithms are important from mathematical, logical thinking and some scientific solutions. Then Kowshik took the session and explained about data. Data refers to distinct pieces of information, usually formatted and stored in a way that is concordant with a specific purpose. Data can exist in various forms: as numbers or text recorded on paper, as bits or bytes stored in electronic memory, or as facts living in a personâ€™s mind. discuss  operators, today explain two types: arithmetic operator and boolean operator.
Arithmetic operator is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on them. They are used in common arithmetic and most computer languages contain a set of such operators that can be used within equations to perform a number of types of sequential calculation. Basic arithmetic operators are addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/) and modulo(%) example addition is to add two values 4+2=6, subtraction is to subtract two values 4-2=2, multiplication it is multiply two values 4*2=8, Division it is divided by given values 4/2=2 and modules is a reminder of the value 9%2=1 it all the example for arithmetic operater. I learn in the process of calculation in mathematical functions. 
Boolean operator is a set of commands that can be used in almost every search engine, database, or online catalogue. The most popular Boolean commands are AND, OR and NOT explain some examples of these operators. AND searches find all of the search terms.  For example, searching on dengue AND malaria AND covid returns only results that contain all three search terms. It is a limited result. OR searches find one term or the other.  Searching on covid OR dengue  OR malaria  returns all items that contain any of the three search terms.  Returns a large number of results. NOT eliminate items that contain the specified term.  Searching on malaria NOT covid returns items that are about malaria, but will specifically NOT return items that contain the word covid. This is a way to fine tune results. 
After the session I am learning about html css coding, trying to create the program and search for their new type of programs. Meet my mentor Gayathri and give some learning tips and ideas.
