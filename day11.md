Today's internship was good. I learned about git commands and html css. Git add- checking the file status and add those files in the staging area. it is used to add any new file and modified file. Git commit- The changes are saved into a local repository, allowing you to describe everyone and help them understand what has happened. Git config- the git config is what username and email id will be used in the local repository, it is used with the global flag, it writes the setting to all repositories on the computer. Git branch- it used to determine what branch the local repository is on, command enables adding and deleting a branch. Create a file in git branch < branch_name>, list all git branch -a, delete git branch -d <branch_name>. Git checkout- switch branches, work started on a different branch. Work three separate entities: file, command and branches. Checkout an existing branch git checkout <branch_name>,Checkout and create a new branch with that name git checkout -b <new_branch>. Git merge- it combines to change one branch to another branch, To changes in the staging branch to the stable branch git merge <branch_name>. Git status- The git status command tells the current state of the repository git status. Git remote- it is used to create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. The connections here are not like direct links into other repositories, but as bookmarks that serve as convenient names to be used as a reference to git remote add origin <address>. Git clone- The git clone command is used to create a local working copy of an existing remote repository. The command downloads the remote repository to the computer. It is equivalent to the Git init command when working with a remote repository git clone <remote_url>. Git pull- it is used to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to the local repository. The command "git pull origin master" copies all the files from the master branch of the remote repository to the local repository. Git push- it is used to transfer the commits or pushing the content from the local repository to the remote repository.
Html css creates a navigation bar to create a top navigation bar to use the css code. Use color, margin, background color and width. All the tags are used to create a top navigation bar. 
Arun took the presentation, he explained about computer network, network topology and computer hardware. A computer network is a set of devices connected through links. A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or receiving the data. Computer hardwares are like monitor, ram, rom, cpu and keyboard.
Then meet one of the operation team Jerfin, he explains about cloud operation, the cloud operations management is the process concerned with designing, overseeing, controlling, and subsequently redesigning cloud operational processes and explains clearly. Befour no idea about the cloud, but now I have found some ideas about cloud operation. After meeting my mentor Gayathri, I explained about today learning.
