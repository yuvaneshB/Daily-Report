Then finally Rexilia took the session explaining html css tags and today discussed The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an html document. The <div> tag is used as a container for html elements which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute. Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag and try this program in my system. Revising all today learning  questions and processes improved myself.
