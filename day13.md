Today my internship started. I am learning about git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development. It is used to track changes in source code. It allows multiple developers to work together. It also supports non linear development processes. Before git, the developer used to submit their codes to the central server without having copies, and any changes to make the source code were unknown to other developers. And no   communication with other developers. After the developers using git  have an entire copy of the source code on the local system, any changes in the source code to be tracked by others and regularly communicate with other developers. Learn the advantages and disadvantages of the git process. After the lunch break Abaraham took the session, explain about binary code, when numbers, letters or words are represented by a specific group of symbols, it is said that the number, letter or word is being encoded. The group of symbols is called a code. The digital data is represented, stored and transmitted as a group of binary bits. This group is also called binary code. The binary code is represented by the number as well as the alphanumeric letter. Advantage of the binary code, binary codes are suitable for computer applications and digital communication. Binary codes make the analysis and designing of digital circuits if we use the binary codes. It is only 0 & 1 are being used, implementation becomes easy. Then Kowshik took the session, he explained about english, symbols, words or tokens and grammer. Grammar is the rules of a language governing the sounds, words, sentences, and other elements, as well as their combination and interpretation. The word grammar also denotes the study of these abstract features or a book presenting these rules. Expression is a particular word, phrase, or form of words, old-fashioned expressions. the manner or form in which a thing is expressed in words, wording, phrasing, delicacy of expression. the power of expressing in words joy beyond expression. The syntax comes from the Ancient Greek for coordination or ordering together. In spoken and written language, syntax refers to the set of rules that determines the arrangement of words in a sentence. Along with diction, it is one of the key ways writers convey meaning in a text. Its rules are sentences that require a subject and a verb and express a complete thought. This is also called an independent clause. A sentence without a subject and a verb is considered a fragment. Separate ideas generally require separate sentences. A sentence containing multiple independent clauses that are improperly joined is considered a run-on sentence. English word order follows the subject,verb,object sequence. A dependent clause contains a subject and a verb but it doesnâ€™t express a complete thought. Arithmetic operator work process, the order of operations is as follows, simplify terms inside parentheses or brackets, simplify exponents and roots, perform multiplication and division, perform addition and subtraction. Multiplication and division are given equal priority, as are addition and subtraction. The process is learned.
