Second day work will be start go and meet my mentor gayathri, she  ask some questions about yesterday tasks, like problem solving and what is SDLC.
Problem solving structure:
Step 1: Understanding the problem.
Step 2: Write down all the constraints.
Step 3: List out the operations
Step 4: And arrange the operation, satifying the constraints.
After i think possible operation to write find the solution of the problem. Then I am explain about the process of sdlc(software development life cycle) following their steps,
Planning:
-This information is then used to plan the basic project approach and to conduct product feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas.
Requirement Analysis:
-Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts.
Architectural Design:
-A design approach clearly defines all the architectural modules of the product along with its communication and data flow.
Software Development:
-Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to generate the code.
Testing:
-This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC
maintenance:
-the product is tested and ready to be deployed it is released formally in the appropriate market. Sometimes product deployment happens in stages as per the business strategy of that organization.
these all the process explain. Her told some new task today and explain about software testing, then i am go to meet all the department  members in our company then I ask everyone what is your role in our company and what kind of software tools using in the project process. All the members are told our work process & software details. It's help to improve my knowledge, After the lunch break  kowshik start the session. This session discusses about how to solve the problem tips and give new task in problem solving questions discuss. Then how to install brave browser in contos 7. Go an scarch in google following their steps and find the error but i will try to solve the problem and find the solution. Then he explain about vim, vim is the text editor toll, explain their following steps. How to create file-vi filename. Txt, open-vi filename.
