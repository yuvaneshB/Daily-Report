After the weekend fifth day internship work starts,my mentor Gayathri discusses some work and asks some questions. Then I learned about the difference between the testing process and some questions. Then she explains about the github method and commends. After that I learned about test plans and test strategy. A Test Plan can be defined as a document that defines the scope, objective, and approach to test the software application. The Test Plan is a term and a deliverable. The test strategy is a set of instructions or protocols which explain the test design and determine how the test should be performed. While it is done by the task manager. 
Test case: 
It is mainly used to test any particular function or any specific aspect of the developed software. Test cases tell that a necessity is completely fulfilled after testing. Test Case is an arrangement of conditions based on the tester performing testing application.
Test script:
Test Script refers to a set of instructions or short program which tests some portion of the functionality of a software product. It is also known as an Automated Test Script because it tests an application automatically. If any test is composed as a small program it is viewed as automatic test scripts. 
Test scenario:
Test Scenario refers to all possible ways of testing a software application. Each probable way or method tests any part of the application like all possible functionalities, attributes, features and aspects of the software.
Test condition:
Test Condition refers to the specification to which the tester follows to perform the testing operation of the software. There can be multiple test conditions to test any software scenario.
