Today my internship started. I am learning to create a web page and login page in html & css, using tags to create the page. To use tags the <label> tag is used to create labels for items in a user interface. Used within <input> tags on a form, the <label> tag is additionally useful because it extends the clickable area of control elements, like buttons. A radio button is an element of the graphical user interface which allows a user to select a single item from a predefined list of options. Radio buttons are often arranged in a group of at least two options. They take the form of a hollow circle which represents a "deselected" state and a circle with a dot inside for a selected state. The <input type="checkbox"> defines a checkbox. The checkbox is shown as a square box that is ticked (checked) when activated. Checkboxes are used to let a user select one or more options of a limited number of choices. submit button to forms is to user clicks it, it automatically submits the form. It takes a value attribute, which defines the text that appears inside the button, input with a type set to button creates a button, which can be manipulated onClick event listener type. It creates a button just like an input type of submit. I met one of the frontend developer team members Ram, he explained about the given tags and usage of <div> tag. Use <div> tag and give all the tags used in <div> tag. Work all the tags and create a different type of login page. Add image and animation to try the frontend design process. After meeting another frontend developer Ernut paul, He explained about ui, ux and wf(wireframe) and explained the difference of user interface (UI) is anything a user may interact with to use a digital product or service. This includes everything from screens and touchscreens, keyboards, sounds, and even lights. User experience, or UX, evolved as a result of the improvements to UI. Once there was something for users to interact with, their experience, whether positive, negative, or neutral, changed how users felt about those interactions. A wireframe is a schematic or blueprint that is useful for helping you, your programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you are building. Then Rexilia took the session,she also explained about the registration form creation method. It is easy to understand the process.
