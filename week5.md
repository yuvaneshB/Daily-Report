The internship started, Kowshik took the session to discuss the project, he split into two teams one team name is Fantastic Five and another team is Six bits. I am in a six bix team. We all discuss the project to share the works and give some ideas in the project,  everyone our ideas are explained  which best that idea takes and use the idea. To create the design in figma, create the model in web application and mobile application both designs are create the first page to add text box and submit button in second page is give timer, refresh button, flip counters and give the model page repeated in again and again to change the size and reduce the fips. It is the basic model of our project and working the languages in this project html & css and javascript use the model to create a front page of our project. First we all choose to create the front page model and start creating the model step by step to give some idea and choose the background image, colour to all are collected to write the code and check the models. Frontend models develop to create the <div> in separate the button and options, label to all the <div> are arranged in single <div-container> it is the first method of the page. To add the colours, images and font. The front page will be created and we start another model. We all again discuss in the another page model to use some animation and add all images to be collected. Move on to create the next page, the model like on timer, how many times the card will be flips count,  best move also calculated and all the cards are arranged in the given types like (2*4), (4*4). Then the card will be arranged in two cards, the two cards are the same images it will dismantle and click the refresh button it will be arranged in all the cards. It is the concept of the second page, we all type the code html & css and javascript files. Start the code step by step and find some error in the code, clear and try to run the code error again and again. Finally to clear the error,  execute the code successfully. After Ernest took the session, he explained the basics of flutter, basic concepts such as widget, container. Body widgets and he explains how to use rows, columns, child, children widget and he explains to types example programs to run and execute the code. Abraham discusses cultural talks . He started off with an analogy between a chef and a cook and how they are  different people who had different inputs but what he was looking for was the difference in the level of risk each one of them was willing to take. The cook does not take risks while a chef takes risks and then he moves on to talking about realities. He said that we are not stuck in the middle of a predefined reality, we define our own reality. That was definitely something to think about and then he moved on to goals. He said that goals should fall in a common area where your wants and reality can intersect. There are certain aspects of your reality that you can change inorder to work towards your goals and there are certain aspects of your reality that you just can not change. He helped us understand that better with an example he asked if he could have a goal to be a basketball player and his present reality is that he is not very tall, he has poor stamina, he has poor physical coordination and that he is old. Now in this reality to work towards his goal, he can work on his stamina and coordination. But he can not get any younger or grow any taller. This was what he used to explain to us his point. Then once we all understood, he asked us to go home and write down all our wants, check it with reality and filter down our goals and also to write down why you want to achieve that goal. Then, after that, he talked about stress. Doing any activity is stressful for a person. It's just that different tasks give different amounts of stress For eg, for a certain person reading a book might be one of the least stressful tasks he can do, whereas for another person, reading a book can be very stressful. So when a person has to do some stressful task, his brain automatically finds some other less stressful tasks first and keeps the stressful task for later. Every person has a stress limit. So when you do any task, the stress of doing that task is stacked upon the stress of the other tasks you did before doing this task. So one should always try to finish their most stressful tasks first. That way you can be more productive. After the cultural talk session, we all went to srm, as bakeholicks had put up a stall in srm. So we all went there to see what all was there tried to do. Then finish the web application and try to push in firebase. All are learning the process in the web application program, listening and learning the process. Then we all learn flutter basics to create the mobile application.
