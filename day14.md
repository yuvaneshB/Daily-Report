Today my internship started. I learned about creating a web page in html & css. Create a web page step by step. Using all the tags in the html & css to add a logo. To create a model page and start the pocess. Creating an attractive page will be difficult for those who are not experts in css. Without using css, you will not be able to make the web page more attractive. So in order to make a web page, we need to have knowledge of html and css. In this article, the main focus will be implementing css. In order to design a web page we need to first create an html web structure. Create a simple structure of a web page by using <li> and <section> tags. So this will create a simple interface which you can check by running the following code. Use css to create designs to give proper design effects to the html web structure that we have created in html code. The most difficult part is to display the picture in a different direction. Consider the picture is in the right direction and the text along with it is in the left direction. The image which is on the right side will be shown on the left side and the text will be shown on the right side.
After the lunch break Kowshik took the session, he explained about function, methods and variables. A function is a rule which relates the values of one variable quantity to the values of another variable quantity, and does so in such a way that the value of the second variable quantity is uniquely determined by the value of the first variable quantity. variable is a quantity that may change within the context of a mathematical problem or experiment. Typically, we use a single letter to represent a variable. The letters x,y and z are common generic symbols used for variables. Sometimes, we will choose a letter that reminds us of the quantity it represents, such as t for time, v for voltage. Write a program explained in the declare function, the function declaration defines a function with the specified parameters. You can also define functions using the Function constructor and a function expression. Compile time error generally refers to the errors that correspond to the semantics or syntax. A runtime error refers to the error that we encounter during the code execution during runtime in their process of working and explaining the process. Abraham took the session, he explained brinay code. 
Then meet my mentor Gayathri, she explains about git branches and git workflow. Git branch in git is used to keep your changes until they are ready. You can do your work on a branch while the main branch master remains stable. After you are done with your work, you can merge it with the main office. Git workflow to get the clone copy to check correct errors and modify the process and push the process. It is all learned about today.
