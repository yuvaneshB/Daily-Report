Fourth day of the internship was really good. The new work uses some types of process. It is useful in the session to learn new types of testing process and how to push in github discussion about the process. Then Kowshik took the session, he explained about the problem solving method and gave some problems. After the lunch break session, Ashkin explained about the responsibility and ownership to discuss. He gives some tips on responsibility and leadership. Then I learn new ideas on how to solve the problem, clearly explaining ownership and responsibility. Then I work on creating a login page in  html, how to create a folder and type the html tags in vim then run the program it is run successfully. That is learning in html by typing the process using. Then I change the color, size in a login page and run the program. After I think about problem-solving solutions, I will learn how to solve the problem one by one. 

Read the problem and rescarching find the constraints. 

-Understand the problem. 

-listen down all the constraints. 

-Find possible operations. 

-Reassigning the operation, while satisfying all the constraints. 

-Clear all the problems easily. 

Then mentor Gayathri give some task took learn about these questions. 

What is testing:

Testing is a key checkpoint in the overall hardware and software development process to determine whether objectives are being met. 

Bug:

Find any mismatch in the application and system in the testing phase then they call it a bug. Bug and defect as well as same things. 

Error:

We can not compile or run a program due to coding mistakes on a program. 

Developer unable to successfully complete or run a program then call it is an error. 

Failure:

The product is deployed and customers find any issues then they call the product a failure product. After release, if an end user finds any issue then that particular issue is also called failure. 

Defect:

Developers find an issue and correct it by themselves in the development phase then it is called a defect.

Then she clearly explains again the process, again giving some questions. I'm going to learn about it. I learn the given questions. Then try the github process and use some command to push the file.
